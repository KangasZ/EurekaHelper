# Contributing to `EurekaHelper`
Contributions are welcome, however, please read the following guidelines before contributing. This project is maintained by me, KangasZ, at the moment, however I intend to maintain the style and patterns of the original plugin. 

## Guidelines
- Ensure you do not rewrite the base of the plugin. The core systems should remain in place and if you have suggestions, make an issue describing what can be done to improve the system.
- Ensure your code follows the style of the rest of the plugin. This means naming, conventions, utility function locations, etc.
- Ensure your code will work with a prior version of the plugin. Any changes should have an automatic migration path. User's don't want to deal with that.
